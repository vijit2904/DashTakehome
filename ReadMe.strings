 I Used MVVM desing pattern and reason behinfd it as follows:-
 
 the flexibility it provide, so can can refector without effection other component and test the app in isolation as well as a whole.
 
 provide modularity and decoupling of the code, which enable to to write more test able code
 
 it provide lots of reusablity both within the across projects in your organization
 
 we can change user interface without having to refactor other logic in the code base
